--refactor--
-move time sizing constants to a separate class and maybe generate them on the fly


-make recap part of day. daily recap of work and fill in the gaps
-overview of flow

--group files--
-regroup the logic, the current pattern of bind everything probably isn't needed if we change to redux

--hooks--
-refactor classes into react hooks

--redux--
-implement https://easy-peasy.now.sh/
-display components based on the redux state, build a state machine for this

--unit tests-
-create for day recap
-look into other classes

--ab testing--
-create an ab component, that takes two components and will record the flow for that component and user to the db

--redesign--
-reduce the sizing of tasks etc
-maybe remove hour overlay and use the space on the left for time. Could have the hour every 3 hours

--day recap--
-fix bug
-add unit test

--flow reporting--
-fix resizing of window

--prelaunch--
-check security (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUBnlbjZFAI&t=142s)
-test on different devices and web browsers
-test timings
-setup billing
-host it with a good domain name (https://domains.google.com/m/registrar/search/favorites?)
-add start info for first time users
-improve the notification ux
-redesign the dayStats and weekStats
-sort the tasks by length or num objectives or age?
-maybe refactor the scroll to view into displaying a separate popup element

----bugs----
-add unit tests (https://jestjs.io/docs/en/tutorial-react)
-when changing daystats, it loads an outdated one and gets ride of the second most recent

----non-essential----
-add offline strategy
-test popout app
 (https://medium.com/javascript-in-plain-english/recreating-spotifys-floating-pop-ups-5dd3603aa7f9)
 (https://googlechrome.github.io/samples/picture-in-picture/)
 (https://w3c.github.io/picture-in-picture/#htmlvideoelement-extensions)
-add an install prompt (for pwa) (https://web.dev/customize-install/)

--personal flow coach--
-maybe add a report of the work completed in the last 25 minutes and a couple of metrics for flow,
 this makes you more aware of what you have done and allows for a day recap. also provides a journal element
-a way to report how you are feeling

-could use flow as a metric
-increase the amount of flow
-find a way to formalise productivity (possibly length * difficulty)
-maybe how productive they reported times time. added to a metric at the end of each task to give a sense of progress

-assigns and changes what task you are working on based on how you are feeling.
 e.g. if bored maybe change to other task
-add ai to suggest the ordering of tasks - for optimal efficiency and to reduce burnout
-suggest different break based on how you are feeling. e.g. meditation or walk if faitgued

-possibly have users report on the current tasks difficult and their current skill level,
 assuming their skill level changes throughout the day. Report this at a each break
 and use it to tailor the current task

-uses machine learning
-provides an overview of day

--ai--
-setup firebase ml using a tensorflow lite model
-experiment with using a monte carlo tree search to order the tasks
-add ai autocomplete for task names and suggested duration
-create different user personality bots to train ai e.g. an organised bot, a procrastinator, a long distance, a sprinter
-create a more data driven application for ai, e.g. allow the ai to change break times, notification durations etc
-add tagging of tasks to enable fair comparison of metrics (e.g. you might compete a programming task quicker than a writing one), store tags on user

Flow producing activity are:

app can control:
We are able to concentrate on the activity / Freedom from distractions
The activity has clear goals / Knowing what to do /
The activity has direct feedback / Knowing how well you are doing / Feedback is immediate
We feel that we control the activity
Our worries and concerns disappear

app can't control:
We are up to the activity
Knowing how to do it
High perceived challenges
High perceived skills
A balance exists between opportunity and capacity
