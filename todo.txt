--ai--
-download data from before 26th april (https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore/manage-data/export-import)
-add ai to suggest the ordering of tasks - for optimal efficiency and to reduce burnout
-experiment with using a monte carlo tree search to order the tasks
-add ai autocomplete for task names and suggested duration
-create different user personality bots to train ai e.g. an organised bot, a procrastinator, a long distance, a sprinter
-create a more data driven application for ai, e.g. allow the ai to change break times, notification durations etc
-add tagging of tasks to enable fair comparison of metrics (e.g. you might compete a programming task quicker than a writing one), store tags on user
-find a way to formalise productivity (possibly length * difficulty)
