--personal coach--
-a way to report how you are feeling
-provides advice based on how you are feeling
-assigns and changes what task you are working on based on how you are feeling. e.g. if bored maybe change to other task
-suggest different break based on how you are feeling. e.g. meditation or walk if faitgued
-uses machine learning
-provides an overview of day

--flow--
-maybe add a report of the work completed in the last 25 minutes and a couple of metrics for flow,
this makes you more aware of what you have done and allows for a day recap. also provides a journal element

-maybe add a daily starter task to get people started e.g. 25 mins of stretching or reading
-add a way to better keep track of the time spent on a task
-could use flow as a metric
-possibly have users report on the current tasks difficult and their current skill level,
 assuming their skill level changes throughout the day. Report this at a each break
 and use it to tailor the current task
-increase the amount of flow


Flow producing activity are:

We are up to the activity.
We are able to concentrate on the activity.
The activity has clear goals.
The activity has direct feedback.
We feel that we control the activity.
Our worries and concerns disappear.
Our subjective experience of time is altered.


Knowing what to do
Knowing how to do it
Knowing how well you are doing
Knowing where to go (if navigation is involved)
High perceived challenges
High perceived skills
Freedom from distractions
Goals are clear
Feedback is immediate
A balance exists between opportunity and capacity

--ai--
-add ai to suggest the ordering of tasks - for optimal efficiency and to reduce burnout
-experiment with using a monte carlo tree search to order the tasks
-add ai autocomplete for task names and suggested duration
-create different user personality bots to train ai e.g. an organised bot, a procrastinator, a long distance, a sprinter
-create a more data driven application for ai, e.g. allow the ai to change break times, notification durations etc
-add tagging of tasks to enable fair comparison of metrics (e.g. you might compete a programming task quicker than a writing one), store tags on user
-find a way to formalise productivity (possibly length * difficulty)
